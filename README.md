# System for the anonymisation of Romanian jurisprudence (SAROJ)
This repository contains code for the implementation of the Action “System for the anonymisation of Romanian jurisprudence (SAROJ)”. The Action was carried out with funding from the Council of Europe. The views expressed herein can in no way be taken to reflect the official opinion of the Council of Europe.

The purpose of the Grant is to support the Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence "Mihai Drăgănescu" (the Grantee) in development of the software anonymisation tool (hereinafter referred to as “anonymisation software)” for the judiciary of Romania. The Superior Council of Magistracy (SCM), as the owner of the case law database of all judicial decisions in Romania, is the final beneficiary of the anonymisation tool that will be developed as the result of this Action. 

The software libraries developed throughout the project may be useful for other natural language processing tasks as well, including named entity recognition and anonymization, given appropriate language resources.
