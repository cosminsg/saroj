max_sequence_length = maximum number of tokens for rule application

Rule fields:

conditions = array of RuleCond conditions; the conditions will be applied sequentially on a sequence of tokens

min = minimum number of matching tokens (default=1)
max = maximum number of matching tokens (default=9999)
