## Installation
For this to work, there are two things that are required:
1. The [Romanian WordPiece tokenizer](https://github.com/racai-ai/ro-wordpiece-tokenizer), that can be installed with `pip install rwpt`.
2. The `model.zip` archive, to unzip and overwrite the folder with the same name in this repository. For now, ask `radu@racai.ro` for the `model.zip` file.
